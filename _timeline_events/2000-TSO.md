    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> As network cards became faster, the cost of sending data became too
burdensome on the CPU and offload to segmentation was designed that pushes the
responsbility of segmenting large data buffers into acceptable MSS sizes to the
device, rather than having to do this in software. This is more generally named 
LSO for Large Send Offload  </p>
