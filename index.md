Welcome to my blog where I plan to write my thoughts, challenges and insights into technical matters concerning Linux systems engineering. I want to focus mostly on the networking as it's my area of expertise but any interesting topic that I will find worthwile I will try writing about. Any non-technical manners that would beg for a blogpost would likely appear here as well, but I'm already getting ahead of myself.
