Hello, I'm Michał from Kraków currently pursuing an engineering PhD at TUe Eindhoven. In my daily work I spend time tinkering with NVIDIA Data Processing Units, which consequently makes me interact with various technologies. I want to use this blog to write up on some of the tasks I've been tackling, firstly to structure my thoughts and secondly, in hopes that some of the theoretical and practical knowledge might be of use to others. Since my general area of research is networking but nowadays more and more focues on embedded systems the posts are naturally going to be revolving around this but any interesting topic that I will find worthwile I will try writing about. Other non-technical manners that would also beg for a blogpost will appear here as well, but that's already getting ahead of myself.
