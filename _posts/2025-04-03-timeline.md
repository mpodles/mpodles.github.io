During my research and with the help of some of past dialogues and experiences I've had, I've came to see how much of my understading of various concepts is expressed by their history - how they came to be and changed over time.

This form of presentation seems to capture well the particular reasons and preconditions that give rise to certain ideas and developments. It also allows seeing a concept in a simpler manner, a one in which it has been fashion in the beginning.
That in turn reshapes the way of viewing it's current or final version - from a tangled multiplicity of ideas to an ensemble of additions compounded onto the original.

For this reason, as I'm working on TCP I've decided to try building it's timeline explicitly and not only in my mind and text, hopefully capturing some of it's important concepts in a way that's both systematic and accessible.
